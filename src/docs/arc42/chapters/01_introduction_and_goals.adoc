== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

diag-agent is an intelligent diagram generation tool that assists LLMs and developers in creating high-quality architecture diagrams. It addresses the common problems of syntax errors and poor layout in LLM-generated diagrams through an autonomous feedback loop.

==== Key Features

* **Autonomous diagram generation** with syntax validation and design feedback
* **Multi-format support** via Kroki integration (PlantUML, C4, BPMN, Mermaid, etc.)
* **Flexible deployment**: CLI tool, MCP server (local/remote), or Docker container
* **Privacy-first**: Local-first approach with optional remote rendering
* **LLM-agnostic**: Works with any LLM via LiteLLM abstraction
* **Context-efficient**: Minimal context consumption through help system and reference URLs

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Motivation

|1
|**Context Efficiency**
|Minimize token consumption in parent LLM conversations through help system, URL references, and self-contained agent logic

|2
|**Ease of Installation**
|Developers should install via pip or docker run without complex setup

|3
|**Privacy & Security**
|No diagram data sent to remote servers without explicit user consent

|4
|**Autonomy**
|Agent iterates independently without requiring parent LLM intervention

|5
|**Extensibility**
|Support for all Kroki diagram types and easy LLM provider switching
