=== ADR-008: Click as CLI Framework

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Command-line UX is the primary entry point; needs structured arguments, good help texts, and compatibility with bash-driven LLM tooling.

**Decision**: Use Click as the CLI framework.

**Alternatives Considered**:
* argparse (stdlib) — stable but verbose, less friendly help output
* Typer — modern and type-hint friendly, but another dependency and smaller ecosystem
* docopt / fire — fast to start, but less control over UX and validation

**Consequences**:
* ✅ Rich help/usage output with minimal boilerplate
* ✅ Mature ecosystem and patterns for nested commands/options
* ✅ Works well with bash and LLM-driven command execution
* ⚠️ Additional dependency vs. argparse
* ⚠️ Some learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with Click
