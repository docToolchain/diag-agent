=== ADR-001: Bash Tool with Help System vs. Always-On MCP

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: LLMs with computer use need diagram generation, but MCP descriptions consume context even when unused.

**Decision**: Primary interface is bash tool with `--help`. MCP mode is optional and explicitly started.

**Consequences**:
* ✅ Context efficient: help text only loaded when needed
* ✅ Works with any LLM that has bash access
* ✅ MCP still available for LLMs without bash
* ⚠️ Two deployment modes to maintain
