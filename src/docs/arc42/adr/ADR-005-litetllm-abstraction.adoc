=== ADR-005: LiteLLM for Provider Abstraction

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to support multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models).

**Decision**: Use LiteLLM as unified interface.

**Consequences**:
* ✅ 100+ models supported
* ✅ Consistent API across providers
* ✅ Easy to add new providers
* ⚠️ Additional dependency
* ⚠️ Abstraction may hide provider-specific features

**Related Quality Goals**: xref:../chapters/10_quality_requirements.adoc#quality-goals[5 Extensibility]
