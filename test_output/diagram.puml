```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
@enduml
```

This PlantUML code creates a simple sequence diagram where:
- Alice sends an "Authentication Request" to Bob (solid arrow)
- Bob sends back an "Authentication Response" to Alice (dashed arrow)

You can copy this code and paste it into any PlantUML renderer to visualize the diagram.
